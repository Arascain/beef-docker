Post-install message from rubyzip:
RubyZip 3.0 is coming!
**********************

The public API of some Rubyzip classes has been modernized to use named
parameters for optional arguments. Please check your usage of the
following classes:
  * `Zip::File`
  * `Zip::Entry`
  * `Zip::InputStream`
  * `Zip::OutputStream`
  * `Zip::DOSTime`

Run your test suite with the `RUBYZIP_V3_API_WARN` environment
variable set to see warnings about usage of the old API. This will
help you to identify any changes that you need to make to your code.
See https://github.com/rubyzip/rubyzip/wiki/Updating-to-version-3.x for
more information.

Please ensure that your Gemfiles and .gemspecs are suitably restrictive
to avoid an unexpected breakage when 3.0 is released (e.g. ~> 2.3.0).
See https://github.com/rubyzip/rubyzip for details. The Changelog also
lists other enhancements and bugfixes that have been implemented since
version 2.3.0.
